# Gesture Dataset Analysis

This blog is maintained by Swadesh Jana about the updates on the progress of GSoC 2021 project with Red Hen Lab.

## Introduction

Hi, I am Swadesh Jana, currently (as of May, 2021) a 2nd year under-graduate Computer Science and Engineering student at Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. I am ethusiatic about Deep Learning, especially Computer Vision and its myriad applications on various aspects of life. Red Hen Lab's Multimodal Communication Research is a very interesting and exciting field that I would love to explore.

## Project Description

My project is on Gesture Detection in Video Dataset annotated by experts. The first task will be to first prepare the dataset for use in gesture detection. This refined dataset will then be used for analtsis and detection using Deep Learning methods. Primarily, my focus will be on utilising the power of Pose Detection models such as OpenPose and then utilising the landmark positions to predict features such as handedness, movement type, orientation etc. (as annotated). Finally, the output will be hosted on CWRU HPC in a pipeline.
